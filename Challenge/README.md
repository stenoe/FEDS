# How to make the final challenge

The final challenge is to make a short video about the things you have been learning.
the time should be at max 10 minutes. 

### The video should contain:

1. How to load data into the notebook
2. create a dataframe and clean the data
3. plot the data and add information to the axes, title, legend
4. anything you like to do or show with the data :) 

- You can use all of the data in the github repository or you can use your own data if you like. 
- Please use at least one function in your workflow.

You should explain what you are doing, just like you gave a presentation lecture.

### Steps you may need to do:

1. prepare your notebook
2. make a screen recording
3. in case you need, cut your video

### Hints and links

I use for screen recording the software OpenBroadcaster Software (OBS) https://obsproject.com/. This is a free program and available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

To cut the video and to transform it into the right formats, I use DaVinci Resolve https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve. This software has a free version option but you may need to sign up with email. The free version is perfect to anything that is needed. 

There are into videos on youtube if you want to check out how to use these.

_You can of course use any other software you are familiar with._
